* Overview

=cljs-tryton= is a Clojure/ClojureScript library that provides a convenient interface for interacting with [[https://www.tryton.org/][Tryton ERP]] systems via JSON-RPC. This library enables both Clojure and ClojureScript applications to communicate with Tryton servers, making it easy to integrate Tryton functionality into web applications, desktop tools, and server-side services.

* Features

- Cross-platform support (Clojure and ClojureScript)
- JSON-RPC communication with Tryton servers
- Session management and authentication
- Synchronous and asynchronous operation support
- Connection pooling and management
- Type-safe data exchange

* Installation

Add the following dependency to your =project.clj=:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
[cljs-tryton "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
#+END_SRC

* Usage

** Basic Connection

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(require '[tryton.con :as con]
         '[tryton.session :as session])

;; Establish connection to Tryton server
(def connection (con/connect {:host "localhost"
                              :port 8000
                              :database "demo"}))

;; Create session with authentication
(def user-session (session/login connection "admin" "password"))
#+END_SRC

** Making RPC Calls

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
;; Example: Fetch records from a model
(session/call user-session "model.party.party" "search_read" 
              [[["name" "ilike" "John"]]] 
              {:fields ["name" "email"]})
#+END_SRC

* API Documentation

The library is organized into several namespaces:

- =tryton.con= - Connection management
- =tryton.session= - Session handling and authentication  
- =tryton.sync= - Synchronization utilities

* Requirements

- Clojure 1.9+ or ClojureScript 1.10+
- Access to a Tryton server with JSON-RPC enabled

* Development

** Running Tests

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
lein test
#+END_SRC

** Building

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
lein jar
#+END_SRC
